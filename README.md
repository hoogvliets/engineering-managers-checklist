## Introduction

Hi, and welcome to the first version of the Engineering Manager's Checklist, very much a work in progress. I've started this little side project to easily remember and document the tasks I have as an Engineering Manager. Note that I have worked mostly in the fields of data science and MLOps so the list might be biased towards that.

## Usage

This document can be used by anyone working in an Engineering Manager position, or anyone trying to learn and understand more about the role of Engineering Manager.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the list feel free to shoot over a PR or contact me through my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hoogvliets/) or [other platforms](https://linktr.ee/hoogvliets) that I am on.

## Acknowledgements

I have based this checklist on my own work experience of the past 15 years. While I am grateful to be standing on the shoulders of many great rolemodels and mentors, it's nearly impossible to trace back specific knowledge and items to specific individuals.

Recently I have started to more actively read leadership and management books. If I encounter any ideas in there that I will share here in the future, I will be sure to credit the respective authors. These first versions of the checklist are based on personal experience.

Additionally I have used `Chat GPT-4o` as a sparring partner to refine my ideas and to format the text into the tidy table below.
